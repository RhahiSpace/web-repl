Hello Kerbonauts and strangers on the Internet.

Recently, RP-1 releases a version 2 of the mod. The already excellent mod looks even better now, I am starting anew in this version, and I am rebooting this blog. Here are my thoughts on how this blog should be written.

## What kind of blog should REPL be?

I am not going to write a journal of playing RP-1 itself. [Encyclopedia Kerbonatica](https://pap1723.github.io/RitS-RP1-MSA/index.html) is a very cool project, but I want to write a blog that I would enjoy reading. I don't think I would enjoy reading detailed mission history, performance data, and successes or failures of rockets made in a video game.

I want this blog to be a place where I can write about what I am interested in, explain what I learned, and showcase what came out of it -- hence the "Dream/Learn/Apply/Fly" structure (see also: [Build-Fly-Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23pkcrHggtw))

## How should I write REPL?

I think it will be nice to provide a natural narrative to read the entire blog from start to end, whenever possible. The main driving force of the blog is that I am playing Kerbal Space Program with RP-1 mod. Then, maybe I can write in an order like:

1. I play the game. The game will throw me interesting challenges, or maybe I may set up a challenge myself.
2. Post "Dream": Based on the challenge, I write a "mission description" that outlines what I am going to write, learn, and do.
3. Post "Build/Learn/Apply": I write about ideas, experience, or something I learned and want to share.
    - Build is about rocket/spacecraft design.
    - Learn is about reading textbooks or documentations.
    - Apply is about programming.
4. Post "Fly": I write a mission report, with a video and relevant data and the pointer to the source code.

The linear story that connects 2, 3, 4 becomes a "series".

I think this structure can work.
