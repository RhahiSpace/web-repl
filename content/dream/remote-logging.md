## Motivation

In this post, I design a new Julia library called RemoteLogging.

This library's goal is to implement a logger that seamlessly integrates with standard Julia logging system, that displays and save logs in any system in the network.

This functionality is useful because I would like to read logs while having access to REPL. Without RemoteLogging, I will get spammed by numerous logs my program will be generating. Additional benefits include:

- Sorting out logs by groups field and saving them individually
- Monitoring logs generated by a remote system.

## Design goals

- Implement a Logger that acts just like any other Julia logger.
- I should be able to direct logging to a local or remote system through TCP.
- Implement a file logging system that sorts out different groups
- All logs should support using custom timestamp generator.

## Interface

- Base logger should be generic and not specific to Kerbal Space Program.
- KSP logger should be a simple extension from base logger in a separate package, `KerbalRemoteLogging`

### Example
```jl
logger = RemoteLogging(; host="127.0.0.1", port="50003")
with_logger(logger) do
    @info "Hello, world!"
end
@info "Hello, planet!"
```

This code should produce log message "Hello, world!" in a remote console, and not in a local console. On the other hand, "Hello, planet!" should appear in the local console.
